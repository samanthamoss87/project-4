# Project 4 - Important Notes
For Project 4, I developed a Thai massage booking system using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, and Bootstrap to create a seamless and interactive user experience. The website allows customers to book massage sessions, and cancel their appointments effortlessly. Django powers the backend, handling user data, appointments, and admin functionality. Bootstrap ensures the site is fully responsive and visually consistent across devices. Javascript handles sending emails, responsive navbar and time selections. This project not only demonstrates my ability to integrate multiple technologies but also provides a practical, real-world solution for managing bookings efficiently.
